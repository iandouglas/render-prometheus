# README

This is a template repository for running a cluster of Prometheus nodes on Render with high availability, and attached persistent disks.

The configuration included here will set up a cluster of 2 to 3 nodes and each node will independently scrape its own data.

You can view [the associated quickstart guide](https://docs.render.com/deploy-prometheus-cluster) for instructions and use, which details which plan levels will support the deployment of this repository.
